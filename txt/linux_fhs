Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard
The latest rendition of FHS was released by Linux Foundation in 2015.

/ (root)
This is the beginning of the Linux filesystem hierarchy. All the file paths originate from the root. The directories listed above or symbolic links to those directories are required in / otherwise, the file structure isn’t FSH compliant.

/bin
Stores essential command binaries which can be used by both system administrator and the user such as cat,ls,mv,ps,mount etc.
These commands are used to boot up a system (access boot files, mount drives) and can be used while repairing a system when the binaries in /usr aren’t available

/boot
This directory contains all the files necessary for the system to boot up
This includes the kernel files, initrd, initramfs, bootloader etc.

/dev
Contains device files for all the physical and virtual devices mounted in the system.
Device files arent files in the traditional sense. They are a way for device drivers to access and interact with the said device
Usually, the primary storage is called sda (/dev/sda)

/etc
This directory contains configuration files of your system.
The name of your device, your passwords, your network configuration, DNS, crontabs, date and time ..etc are stored here in configuration files.
This directory cannot contain any binary executable files according to FHS.
These configuration files affect all users on the system. If you want to make config changes for a specific user, ~/.conf/ should be used instead of /etc/

/home
The home contains all the personal user-specific files. It contains separate directories for each user which can be accessed by cd /home/username
This is where you do most of your work. All the downloads, pictures, music etc on your system are in /home.
The user-specific configuration file for each application can be found in /home/[username]/.conf
You can go to any users home directory by executing cd ~[username] . If there is only one user on the system, just cd ~ works.

/lib
Libraries are standard code files that define the commands used in a programming language. During compilation, a compiler looks up these libraries to make sense of the code just as we might look up a dictionary to understand the meaning of words while reading a book.
This directory contains all the libraries needed to boot up the system and for commands in /bin and /sbin to run.
This also contains kernel modules which control a lot of your hardware and device functioning
A lot of times, there are different 32-bit and 64-bit libraries with the same name. To avoid any collusion, these binaries are kept in two separate directories accordingly named /lib32 and /lib64.

/media
This directory contains several sub-directories where the system mounts removable devices such as USB drives.

/mnt
This directory can be used by a user to manually mount a device. (as opposed to /media which is only used by the system)
The current convention among users is making a separate subdirectory under /mnt and mounting the device in that subdirectory, while the older tradition is mounting the device directly in /mnt.

/opt
/opt contains libraries and binaries related to packages which are not installed by your system’s package managers but are installed through third-party means like using Discord’s in-application update button.
/opt is a less popular alternative to /usr/local . It is the vendor who decided where the libraries and binaries go but usually more monolithic and proprietary software like zoom use /opt .

/run
This directory contains the metadata of the device since the last boot.
This includes data of all the system processes and daemons that were executed in the current session.
Files under this directory are cleared (removed or truncated) at the beginning of the boot process.

/sbin
Just like /bin, /sbin also contains essential system binaries. However, these binaries are only meant to be used by a system administrator rather than a normal user.
These binaries are mostly used for device management. For example, fdisk, fsck, mkfs, ifconfig, reboot.

/srv
You will only ever use this directory if your device is acting as a webserver, as this directory contains all the files regarding web servers.
For example if host a FTP connection, all the files that need to be shared should by default go in a /srv/ftp.

/tmp
Contains temporary files of the currently running processes.
This data is also flushed after every boot.

/proc
Just like /dev which provides devices as files, this folder contains system information and kernel information as files.
This includes information regarding memory, partitions, hardware (battery, temperature etc), all loaded kernel modules etc.

/sys (distro specific)
It contains information similarly held in /proc/, but displays a hierarchical view of specific device information in regards to hot-plug devices.

/var
Contains variable data regarding the running processes.
This includes the logs, cache and spools for all applications.
Spools are the data which are waiting for further processing. For example, A document waiting in the printer queue or an email header waiting to be sent.

/lost+found (ext4 feature)
While not listed in the FHS, this directory is automatically generated by fsck.
It stores all the orphaned and corrupted files in this folder.
This includes the files you couldn’t save because of a power cut, files corrupted due to a failed upgrade process etc.

/root (optional)
This is supposed to be the home directory for the root user, as opposed to /home which is the home directory for the non-root users.

/usr
The /usr directory has very interesting origins. At the time of formation, it was supposed to act like the /home directory, but when people ran out of space on /bin, they started storing the non-essential binaries in /usr.
Over time, this directory has been fashioned to store the binaries and libraries for the applications that are installed by the user. So for example, while bash is in /bin (since it can be used by all users) and fdisk is in /sbin (since it should only be used by administrators), user-installed applications like vlc are in /usr/bin.
This way /usr has its own hierarchy just like the / (root) did.

/usr/bin
This is the primary directory of executable commands on the system.
Contains all user-installed command binaries and
If you want to execute your scripts using a single command, you usually place them in /usr/bin/

/usr/sbin
This contains user-installed command binaries that can only be used by system administrators.

/usr/lib
This contains the essential libraries for packages in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin just like /lib.

/usr/local
This is used for all packages which are compiled manually from the source by the system administrator.
This directory has its own hierarchy with all the bin, sbin and lib folders which contain the binaries and applications of the compiled software.

/usr/share
Contains several architecture-independent miscellaneous files
Man files, word lists (dictionaries) and definition files are all included in this.
